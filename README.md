# KrylovKit
This repository contains Matlab files to handle standard, extended and rational Krylov sequences by operating on QR factorized representations of the recurrence matrices. This representation allows for a straightforward transition between the three different types of Krylov recurrences and leads to a unified approach for the implicit restart of the iteration.


## NOTE
The Matlab functions are currently still under development. The majority of the functions still need to be added, implemented or modified.
